# Project 3 - *Yelpr*

**Yelpr** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Search results page
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [x] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [x] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [x] Edited UI
- [x] Removed Status Bar
- [x] Added Annotations on Map
- [x] Edited LaunchScreen
- [x] Changed Default Location to Jacksonville, FL

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Get Location of User
2. Store User Favorites

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Implementing the map took some time. No doubt, autolayout caused me some grief, but the app turned out great!
